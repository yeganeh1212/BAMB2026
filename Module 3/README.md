# Module 3: Learning to act

Welcome to the BAMB! 2026 tutorial for Module 3. The question behind this module is a simple one: how does an agent, biological or artificial, learn to act? There are two very different answers to it, and we take one in each part.

1. [From bandits to gridworlds](./part1_sequential_decisions/): learning to act by *trial and error*.
   - Intro to structuring your agents and environments properly by following [gym API standards](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium?tab=readme-ov-file#api)
   - Intro to RL algorithms in their simplest, tabular form
   - Extending them to classic control environments such as [CartPole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)
2. [Imitation learning on a real robot](./part2_imitation_learning/): learning to act by *copying someone who already knows how*.
   - Why animals, ourselves included, mostly do not learn the way our Q-learning agent does
   - Real demonstration data from an [SO-101 robot arm](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101), recorded with [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot)
   - Behavioural cloning: fitting a policy to demonstrations, which turns out to be maximum-likelihood model fitting in disguise
   - And a policy trained exactly that way, driving the real arm at the front of the room

In Module 2, you fit RL models to behaviour on tasks where a single choice was followed immediately by a reward. Part 1 picks up exactly there and adds everything those tasks leave out: states, transitions, and rewards that only arrive long after the action that earned them. Part 2 then takes the reward away altogether, which is closer to how you learned most of what you know.

The mini-project for this module is described in [mini_projects.md](./mini_projects.md). There is one, everybody does it, and the best few policies in the class get deployed on the real arm on the last day.

## Installation

We will try to run everything on Google Colab. However, if you wish to run the code locally on your machine, follow the installation instructions below.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are on Windows, we *highly* recommend installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Open PowerShell or Windows command prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator", enter the ```wsl --install``` command, then restart your machine. Then open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), hit `Ctrl + Shift + P`, and search "WSL" to select the "WSL: Connect to WSL". Check that the bottom-left of your VSCode window says "WSL: Ubuntu".

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a modern python packaging and project management software. Hopefully, this will make development a breeze and keep track of new packages that any developer installs in the pyproject.toml file. It is also *ridiculously* fast, and it will fetch the right version of python for you, so you don't have to worry about that either. If you are unfamiliar with it, [here's a quick tutorial](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/). To get started, you can use the following commands:

```sh
# clone the BAMB2026 git repository if you don't already have it
gh repo clone bambschool/BAMB2026
# if you don't have gh installed, use the git clone command below
# git clone https://github.com/bambschool/BAMB2026.git

# jump into the folder for this tutorial (note the space in the folder name)
cd "BAMB2026/Module 3/"

# change branch to main and pull
git checkout main
git pull

# install uv if you don't have it already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# create the environment and install dependencies
uv sync
```

That's it. `uv sync` creates the virtual environment in `.venv` within the project folder, grabs the correct python version, and installs everything from the lock file, so everyone gets exactly the same setup.

You don't actually need to activate the environment: prefix any command with `uv run` and it will run inside the project's environment. If you would rather activate it anyway, `source .venv/bin/activate` does the job as usual.

## Usage

To work through the tutorial notebook for part 1, launch it with:

```sh
# from the "Module 3/" folder
uv run jupyter lab part1_sequential_decisions/tutorial_3a.ipynb
```

Part 2 needs one extra step. It depends on [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot), which drags in torch, OpenCV and a video stack, roughly a gigabyte of it, and there is no reason to make everybody install all that just to run part 1. So it sits in an optional dependency group that `uv sync` leaves out by default. Ask for it explicitly:

```sh
# from the "Module 3/" folder
uv sync --group robot
uv run jupyter lab part2_imitation_learning/tutorial_3b.ipynb
```

We recommend Colab for part 2 regardless, since nothing in it needs a GPU and the notebook installs what it needs by itself.

If you prefer VSCode, just open the notebook and select the `.venv` interpreter in the top-right kernel picker.

Anything else you want to run goes through `uv run` in the same way, for instance the tests:

```sh
uv run pytest
```

And if you ever need to add a package, `uv add <package>` will install it and record it in `pyproject.toml` and the lock file for everyone else.

## VS Code extensions

If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), which we highly recommend, install the following extensions as they would be very useful:

# Resources

If you have heard of RL, you have inevitably heard of the wonderful [Sutton Barto book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf), which is an excellent resource to get started with. However, there are some incredibly useful resources other than books that may help you absorb the material much quicker while going deeper than the book. Here are some that I have found useful:

## Lecture series

If you're new to RL, the first ones I would recommend would be:

- [David Silver's RL course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-), and
- [Martha & Adam White's RL specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning#courses) if you can spare a little more time

Once you have a decent grasp of the basics, I would highly recommend the following courses from the Berkeley and Stanford giants that will surely take you to the state-of-the-art RL:

- [Pieter Abbeel's Foundations of Deep RL](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjNymuBM9RdmB3Z9N5-0IlY0)

## Additional resources for Programming in python

### Books

- [The good research code handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/index.html)
- [Learn Python the hard way by Zed Shaw](https://rupert.id.au/python/book/learn-python3-the-hard-way-nov-15-2018.pdf) 

### Arjancodes

##### Software design course + pythonic design patterns

By far, the best course out there that not only offers an introduction to the formal concepts but goes through the practical details is Arjan's [Software Design Mindset](https://www.arjancodes.com/mindset). For anyone who learns like I do, this is an absolute gem.

There is also an extension that includes Pythonic design patterns that I cannot find the link for but can highly recommend once you get through the first course.

Together, they're so comprehensive and manage to cover every aspect of modern pythonic programming. It has dramatically increased my productivity as a developer and made the whole process so much more enjoyable.

##### YouTube

If you cannot afford the course, I would still recommend [Arjancodes' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/arjancodes). He has some fantastic videos that put the principles into practice. Some of my early favorites, before I eventually decided to take his course, were [cohesion and coupling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiDyK_ofPPM), [composition vs inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcP8ZpUR38), [SOLID design principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB30aXS77U), [abstraction and composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka70COItN40&t=3s), the other videos on refactoring data science projects (pt [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx4AxbQNv3U), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fFqakxhW84)), and then some others on using [dataclasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRVVyl9uaZc), [pydantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj-iU-8_xLs), [ABC vs protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvb5hGLoK0A&t=248s). that make OOP life easier.
